Thwip is a Django back-end that imports a comic-archive collection and retrieves the appropriate metadata from [Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/), and provides a REST api that will allow you to read your comics. The React frontend can be found at [Thwip-Frontend](https://github.com/bpepple/thwip-frontend).
